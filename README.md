# About this project
This project is a work in progress. It involves porting the low-level TFT ILI9486 driver from the Adafruit Arduino library to the STM32F446RET6. The middleware layer class is inherited from the Adafruit library, and the programming is done at the register level to optimize speed and reduce overhead.
